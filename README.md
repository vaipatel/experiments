## 2 link Inverse Kinematics (:x:)

An attempt to reproduce the 2-link Robot Arm Inverse Kinematics estimation from
the [1994 Mixture Density Network paper by Bishop](https://bit.ly/2VAtYM3).

Status: Failing to reproduce the result of improvement in position prediction of the robot arm's end-effector using a Mixture Density Network. But successfully (IMO) reproduced the simple MLP baseline attempted prior to the MDN.
